What is Bunny?
=================


Bunny aims to be a RabbitMQ administration and testing/development swiss
army knife. It allows you to do a large (and growing) number of tasks that are
supported by RabbitMQ's RESTful HTTP Management API. To get a list of current
tasks that are supported, run '?' from within the shell. Here's the output
at time of writing (Feb. 2012):

::

  guest@localhost: ?

  Documented commands (type help <topic>):
  ========================================
  create_binding   delete_exchange  get_status           list_vhosts   xlist
  create_exchange  delete_queue     list_queue_bindings  purge_queue
  create_queue     dump_message     list_users           send_message

  Undocumented commands:
  ======================
  EOF  connect  exit  help  qlist


Features
-------------

- It's easy to use and works on any RabbitMQ server running the HTTP
Management API.
- Provides an interactive shell to issue commands to the server.
- Optional 'one-shot' mode: you don't *have* to launch a full-blown shell if
you just want to send one command to a host.
- Optional config file makes it easy to deal with managing a lot of servers
without getting carpal tunnel syndrome.
- Really easy to extend to add new commands.
- If readline is available, command history and completion should
work. On my test machine (a mac running Lion), history and
completion both work.

Requirements
----------------

- argparse (unless you're using Python >=2.7. Get a backported argparse for
         Python <=2.6 at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse)
- pyrabbit (I wrote this too: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyrabbit)
- PyYaml (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML)
